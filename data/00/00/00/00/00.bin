  |   It is 1873. An escaped slave is slowly walking through the desert,    |
  |   making his way from Mexico to Texas. He keeps a revolver close and    |
  |   is wearing the sombrero stolen from a dead man.                       |
  |                                                                         |

  |   You'll need to cock the revolver with one trigger before being able   |
  |   to shoot by pressing another trigger. One false move and you'll be    |
  |   overrun in an instant.                                                |

  |   Live through the journey of an escaped Mexican prisoner fighting      |
  |   for survival and freedom in the 1870's in the United States.          |
  |                                                                         |

  |   You can choose to take a more stealthy approach to surprise your      |
  |   enemies, or even just sneak straight past them.                       |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Real places and towns, the spirit of the desert and the most          |
  |   desperate bandidos of the district will help you to plunge into the   |
  |   breathing and cruel world of the Wild West.                           |
  |                                                                         |

  |   You'll find breastplates that will have a 50% chance to deflect       |
  |   some bullets, a fast recharging skill that will allow the hero to     |
  |   insert 2 bullets at once, extreme accuracy (less spread for your      |
  |   shots), being able to kill an enemy in stealth without attracting     |
  |   the unwanted attention of his friends, and more!                      |
